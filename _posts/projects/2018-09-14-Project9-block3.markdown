Created a landing page for block3. A blockchain workspace and knowledge hub in Seattle.

I was given an idea for a landing page and where it needed to link to. 

Since no complicated were needed for the page I decided to use plain HTML and CSS to accomplish structure and styling. I used the built in CSS Grid property for responsive design. 

While load time is very fast further improvemnts could be made with optimizations
