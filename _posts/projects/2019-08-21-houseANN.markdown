Create an artificial neural network(ANN) with keras and python to do regression prediction on housing prices with the Seattle house price dataset


## About:

This project / case study is for phase 1 of my [100 days of machine learning code](https://sageelliott.com/100daysofmlcode/) challenge.

This is a homework solution to a section in [Deep Learning and Machine Learning Practical Workouts](https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-machine-learning-practical).
