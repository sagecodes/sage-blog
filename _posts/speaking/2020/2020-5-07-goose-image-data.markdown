Join me at this talk for a start-to-finish journey from data collection, through training data set creation for computer vision projects.

In this talk I'll be using the Canadian Goose as an example, but the methods I used should work on many types of image datasets.

From this talk, you'll learn about:

How to think about image data while collecting it
Ways to overcome a limited data by creating synthetic samples
Selecting models for use cases
Using HyperLabel (https://hyperlabel.com/) to easily create a local labeled dataset for object detection
Using your labeled data to train a popular object detection model
I hope you'll leave with the inspiration and resources you need to create your own computer vision object detection project!
