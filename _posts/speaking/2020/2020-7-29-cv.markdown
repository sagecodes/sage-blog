This workshop is a beginner friendly introduction about using Deep Learning for Computer Vision!
About this Event
Join us for Part 2 of this Intro to Computer Vision workshop!

Thanks to advancements in deep learning and artificial neural networks, computer vision is increasingly capable of mimicking human vision and is paving the way for self-driving cars, medical diagnosis, scanning recorded surveillance, manufacturing and much more.

In this introductory workshop, Sage Elliot will give an overview of deep learning as it related to computer vision with a focused discussion around object detection. Object Detection is the foundation of identifying and locating objects of certain classes in the image

What You Will Learn:

- Computer Vision Systems for object detection and image segmentation

- Practical Data Labeling for Computer Vision Projects

- Train a computer vision model for Object Detection
