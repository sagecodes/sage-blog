Training today's complex AI models requires combining various steps into an interconnected workflow. Modern MLOps tooling helps you scale your AI training by orchestrating these workflows. Great tooling provides a reliable framework for your machine learning operations by streamlining processes, increasing efficiency, and adding reproducibility.
This workshop will equip you with the skills to harness these benefits effectively and show you how to build AI workflows for LLMs 

using Union.ai, Hugging Face, and Weights and Biases. This workshop will cover:
* Fine-tune a Hugging Face LLM model.
* Build a scalable workflow using Union.ai (powered by Flyte).
* Integrate with Weights & Biases for experiment management.
What you'll need to follow along: A free Union.ai account (Link provided at workshop), a free Weights & Biases account for logging metrics, a GitHub account, and a google account to follow along in Colab.
