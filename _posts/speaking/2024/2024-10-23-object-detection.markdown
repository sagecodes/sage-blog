This workshop will equip you with the skills to effectively build your computer vision and ML pipelines using Python, PyTorch and Flyte/Union.

We'll cover data annotation for object detection, model fine-tuning, versioning, building an effcient AI pipeline, and running batch inference on the trained CV model.

Afterwards you'll be able to build your own computer vision object detetection models and custom datasets! What you'll learn can also be transferred to different types of AI and ML pipelines

The workflow we'll build hands-on together:

Download Dataset
Download pre-trained model weights
Initialize object detection model
Pre-process Data & Visualize Datasets
Fine-tune model with PyTorch
Evaluating Object Detection Models
Save model to Hugging Face Hub
Perform batch predictions in Cloud
