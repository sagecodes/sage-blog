There’s no question that AI-powered agents are here to stay in modern technical workflows. But agents present unique challenges that “traditional” AI and ML don’t have, especially when it comes to being fault-tolerant. Because agents rely on stateful execution, error recovery is more complicated, as restarting agentic workflows can be expensive and time-consuming. Additionally, because agents operate continuously, deploying updates can be tricky and risk breaking active workflows. And when things do go wrong, debugging agents in production can be a nightmare because logs are scattered across myriad vendors, with no unified timeline nor trace.
