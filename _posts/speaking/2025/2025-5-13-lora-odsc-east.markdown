Training complex AI models at scale requires orchestrating multiple steps into a reproducible workflow and understanding how to optimize resource utilization for efficient fine-tuning. Modern MLOps and LLMOps tools help streamline these processes, improving the efficiency and reliability of your AI pipelines. This workshop will introduce you to the basics of MLOps and best practices for building efficient AI pipelines for large language models (LLMs).

By completing this workshop, you'll gain hands-on experience structuring scalable and reproducible AI workflows for fine-tuning LLMs using best practices such as caching, versioning, containerized resource utilization, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and more. We'll use Hugging Face for transformers and datasets, PEFT for implementing LoRA and QLoRA, bitandbytes for quantization, and union.ai for scalable workflows, GPUs, and serving our fine-tuned model.
