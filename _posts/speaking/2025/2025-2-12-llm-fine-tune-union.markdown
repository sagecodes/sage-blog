Training today's complex AI models requires combining various steps into an interconnected workflow. Modern MLOps/LLMOps tooling helps you scale your AI training by orchestrating these workflows. Great tooling provides a reliable framework for your machine learning operations by streamlining processes, increasing efficiency, and adding reproducibility.

This workshop will equip you with the skills to harness these benefits effectively and show you how to build AI workflows for fine tuning LLMs using Hugging Face, and union.ai.
