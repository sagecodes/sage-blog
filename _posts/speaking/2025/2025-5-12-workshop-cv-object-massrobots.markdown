We'll cover data annotation for object detection, model fine-tuning, versioning, building an efficient AI pipeline, and deploy the trained computer vision model.

Afterwards you'll be able to build your own computer vision object detection models, custom datasets, adn efficient AI pipelines! What you'll learn can also be transferred to different types of AI and ML pipelines.
