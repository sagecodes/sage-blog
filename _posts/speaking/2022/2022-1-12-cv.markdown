Build your own object detection model from start to finish. Includes how to do data annotation and model training on your own dataset
About this Event
Join this hands on workshop to get started with Computer Vision & Object Detection.

Being able to classify and localize where an object is in an image is foundational to many computer vision applications.

In this workshop we'll cover:

High Level Computer Vision Applications & Concepts
How to label your own dataset for object detection & computer vision
How to train your model using python & detectron2 (A PyTorch based modular object detection library)
Run the model for object detection on images and video
