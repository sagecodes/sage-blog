Join this hands-on workshop to build and monitor a summarization application using OpenAI, LangKit, WhyLabs, and Gradio!

The ability to effectively evaluate and monitor large language models (LLMs) like GPT from OpenAI has become essential in the rapidly advancing field of AI. WhyLabs, in response to the growing demand, has created a powerful new open source tool named LangKit, to ensure LLM applications can be better evaluated, monitored, and operated responsibly.
