A hands-on workshop to monitor ML models for bias & fairness with data segmentation & tracing in production

In this workshop weâ€™ll cover how to get started with ML monitoring for bias & fairness with segmentation and performance tracing.

Deploying machine learning (ML) models is only part of the journey. Monitoring data pipelines and model performance is critical to ensure AI applications are robust and responsible.
