Join this hands-on workshop to implement ML monitoring on Hugging Face models with WhyLabs LangKit.

The ability to effectively monitor and manage large language models (LLMs) like GPT from OpenAI has become essential in the rapidly advancing field of AI. WhyLabs, in response to the growing demand, has created a powerful new tool, LangKit, to ensure LLM applications are monitored continuously and operated responsibly.
