This post will cover how to find the median(the middle number) from a set of numbers. We'll then implement a solution in the python programming language!

For this example we will find the mean for this set of numbers: 

`5,7,2,6,9,12,1` 

Step1: Sort your list of numbers in the order of least to greatest

`1,2,5,6,7,9,12`

step2: Find which number is in the middle

`1,2,5,`**`6`**`7,9,12`

In this example the median for `5,7,2,6,9,12,1` is `6`

If the list of numbers has an even amount of numbers find which TWO numbers are in the middle:

`1,2,4,5,6,7,9,12`

`1,2,4,`**`5,6,`**`7,9,12`

Add those two numbers together 
`5+6 = 11`

divide them by 2:
 
 `11/2 = 5.5`
 
 Median = `5.5`
