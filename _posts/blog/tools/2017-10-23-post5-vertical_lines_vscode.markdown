# Vertical Lines in Visual Studio code (VS Code)

I've really enjoyed having vertical lines in my text editor(sublime) for a couple years now. My first mentor had me make them at 79, 99, and 119 characters and rated them as good, OK, and going past 119 as maybe you need to rethink what you're doing.

When I started developing more in python and using pep8 it was super handy to already have your editor show where you should ideally be breaking up your code.

Recently I've switched to trying out VS Code as my main editor and wanted to spread the joy of setting up vertical bars, here you go!
