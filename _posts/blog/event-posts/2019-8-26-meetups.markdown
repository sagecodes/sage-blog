Hello everyone, I started my new job at [HyperLabel](https://hyperlabel.com/)
and should now have consistent time to start posting these every week again!

Remember be kind and patient with all event hosts. Many have not done online events before and we're all still learning!

If you'd like them delivered to your inbox (coming soon) you can sign up [here](https://mailchi.mp/32d244a64668/techseattle).
