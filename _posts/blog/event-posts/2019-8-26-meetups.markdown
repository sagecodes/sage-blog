Time to start posting weekly event round ups again.  
Events are going virtual so these won't be only Seattle based for the time being.
I'll improve finding more virtual as I keep posting. 

Remember be kind and patient with all event hosts. Many have not done online events before and we're all still learning!

If you'd like them delivered to your inbox (coming soon) you can sign up [here](https://mailchi.mp/32d244a64668/techseattle).
