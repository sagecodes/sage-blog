A diary type post of my 100 days of Machine learning code (#100DaysofMLcode)

## Day 1

Continue learning about classification models in scikit learn

a couple of k-NN implementations as I  Continuing work thru common classification models in sklearn. I had done an iris k-NN before but using an external dataset let me use Label Encoders!

## Day 2

Went to a @ps_python meetup discussing time series forecasting at scale with FB Prophet so I thought I would do an implementation using it. Used it on a Chicago crime dataset. 

Read more about prophet here: https://peerj.com/preprints/3190.pdf

## Day 3

Another prophet forecasting implementation on one of the most important commodities ðŸ¥‘ Avocados! The price looks like its dropping over all across the US but rises  across west coast regions. I'll never be able to buy a house #millennial

Refreshed on some SQL and updating content on a SQL workshop

## Day 4

Learned more about using decision trees and random forests also about text feature extraction with sklearn CountVectorizer.
Used this to predict is a customer reviews on alexa were positive or negative.
