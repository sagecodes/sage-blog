A diary type post of my 100 days of Machine learning code [#100DaysofMLcode](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfMLCode&src=tyah).

## Day 1 ☑

Continue learning about classification models in scikit learn.

I did a couple of k-NN implementations as I Continue working through common classification models in sklearn. I had done an iris k-NN before but using an external dataset let me use Label Encoders!

#### Code for the day:

- [Iris Classification](https://github.com/sagecodes/irsit-classification2-knn)
- [T-Shirt Classfication](https://github.com/sagecodes/tshirt-size-prediction-KNN)



## Day 2 ☑

Went to a [Python Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PSPPython/) discussing time series forecasting at scale with FB Prophet so I thought I would do an implementation using it. Used it on a Chicago crime dataset. 

Read more about forecasting at scale with prophet [here]( https://peerj.com/preprints/3190.pdf).

Read more about Time series [here](https://otexts.com/fpp2/arima.html). 

 Find the github for Facebook prohet [here](https://github.com/facebook/prophet). 

#### Code for the day:

- [Chicago Crime Rate forecast](https://github.com/sagecodes/chicago-crime-prediction-fbprophet)
 

## Day 3 ☑

Another prophet forecasting implementation on one of the most important commodities 🥑 Avocados! The price looks like its dropping over all across the US but rises  across west coast regions. I'll never be able to buy a house #millennial

Refreshed on some SQL and updating content on a SQL workshop

#### Code for the day:

- [Avocado Price forecast](https://github.com/sagecodes/avocado-forecasting-fbprophet)
- [Intro to SQL workshop for my workshop](https://github.com/sagecodes/intro-to-sql)


## Day 4 ☑

Learned more about using decision trees and random forests also about text feature extraction with sklearn CountVectorizer.
Used this to predict is a customer reviews on alexa were positive or negative.

Dataset used: [Kaggle Amazon Alexa Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/sid321axn/amazon-alexa-reviews)

#### Code for the day:

- [Alexa Amazon Review Classfication](https://github.com/sagecodes/Amazon-Review-Classification-Random-Forest)




## Day 5 ☑

More Random Forests

More Decision Trees and Random Forests. I'm really impressed with the random forest results! Used this Kyphosis Kaggle datset and visually it seems very hard to classify data points, but the classifier worked well. Cool to see how much better the random forest performed vs just the decsion tree.

Dataset used: [Kaggle Kyphosis](https://www.kaggle.com/abbasit/kyphosis-dataset)

#### Code for the day:

[Kyphosis Prediction Random Forest](https://github.com/sagecodes/kyphsis-classifier-random-forest/blob/master/kyphosis-prediction-random-forest.ipynb)


## Day 6 ☑

Built Naive Bayes classifier on Email dataset to detect spam / not spam. 

Also used Naive Bayes classifier a credit card dataset to detect fraud.

Completed [ Machine Learning Classification Bootcamp in Python](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-MWZST68M/)




#### Code for the day:

- [Email Spam Classifer with Naive Bayes](https://github.com/sagecodes/spam-classifier-naive-bayes/blob/master/Spam%20classifier.ipynb)
- [Credit Card Fraud with Naive Bayes](https://github.com/sagecodes/credit-fraud-classfier-naive-bayes/blob/master/Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Classifier.ipynb)


## Day 7 ☑

1 week down! 🎉

Today was a good refresher on performing linear regrssion with scikit learn.

I Performed 2 simple linear regression case studies. Temperature vs. ice cream revenue (relevant today in Seattle) & Horsepower vs fuel consumption.

#### Code for the day:

- [Icecream vs. Temp](https://github.com/sagecodes/Icecream-temp-simple-linear-regression/blob/master/ice%20cream%20vs%20temp%20regression.ipynb)
- [Fuel Consumption vs. horsepower](https://github.com/sagecodes/fuel-consumption-linear-regression/blob/master/fuel%20consumption.ipynb)
