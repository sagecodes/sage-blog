This is a list of resources to start learning python. There are SOO many
tutorials and options so you should certainly explore more and use what
works best for you, but here are some to help get you started!

Let me know what resources you really enjoy or what should be added to this list!

If you're in Seattle I often teach free introduction to python classes.
