I don't know about you but I often find myself referring back to documentation or googling commands I should know by now. So I made myself a list:

Full list and documentation from conda is [here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

## Usual suspects:

create enviroment

`conda create --name myenv`
`conda create -n myenv python=3.4`

windows: `activate myenv` Mac/linux: `source activate myenv`

activate enviroment
deactivate enviroment

windows: `deactivate` mac: `source deactivate`

update
install

view list:

conda env list
