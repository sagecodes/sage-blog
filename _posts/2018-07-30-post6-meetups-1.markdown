Going to meetups is an amazing way to meet new people, learn new skills, and find new career opportunities. Attending meetups is my number one tip when job searching!

I get asked a lot about what meetups are worth going attending. It can be time consuming and sometimes hard to keep up with all of them going on in Seattle, so I'm creating a weekly list of meetups I think are notable and hopefully worth your time to check out! Go out and talk to people! Am I missing any notable meetups? Tweet at me! [@sagecodes]({{site.twitter}})
