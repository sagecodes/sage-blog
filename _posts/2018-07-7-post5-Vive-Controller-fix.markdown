# Vive Controller Fix

## What Happened

I set my vive up in a new location. What I though would be the best spot out my limited options. Of course I had to make sure everything worked by playing a couple rounds of [Beat Saber](). During only my 2nd round I hit the controller pretty hard on the kitchen bar edge.

## It worked!

Hey it worked! The controller is now tracking again! The audio and haptic feedback no longer on the controller though... Likely damaged during the impact, but it could of also been from me opening up everything and maybe not being as careful as I should have been.
