<h2 id="what-happened">What Happened</h2>

<p>I set my vive up in a new location. What I though would be the best spot out my limited options. Of course I had to make sure everything worked by playing a couple rounds of <a href="http://www.beatsaber.com/">Beat Saber</a>. During only my 2nd round I hit the controller pretty hard on the kitchen bar edge. After doing this the controller stopped tracking completely. :(</p>

<p>Picture of the damage on the outside:</p>

<h2 id="taking-it-apart">Taking it apart</h2>

<p>Heres what i didâ€¦ Donâ€™t blame me if you break your controller even more!</p>

<p>What I needed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>T5 Screwdriver</li>
  <li>To get over my fear of taking it apart</li>
</ul>

<p>I removed the first 5 screws located on the bottom of screwdriver(One screw has a stick on it. I believe to show you voided your warranty). A friend shared this <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ne9qdq/warranty-void-if-removed-stickers-illegal-ftc">article</a> with me after this post about warranty void stickers. You may fiind it interesting.</p>

<p>This top part of the circle came off pretty easy for me. You may need to pull up multiple sides for it to come all the off:</p>

<p><img src="../../img/4vive.jpg" alt="vive controller top" /></p>

<p><img src="../../img/5vive.jpg" alt="vive controller side" /></p>

<p>Next these 3 screws needs to be removed:</p>

<p><img src="../../img/6vive.jpg" alt="vive controller screws" /></p>

<p>Ooooh the top part is so cool looking!</p>

<p><img src="../../img/7vive.jpg" alt="vive controller top" /></p>

<p>The bottom of the circle was the hardest part for me to take off. I ended up squeezing the sides the protrude out and pulling hard hoping for the best. the piece came off without breaking.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/8vive.jpg" alt="vive controller side" /></p>

<p>The last 3 screws! The one highlighted by a poorly drawn exclamation point actually holds the entire circle part onto the handle. If your ribbon cables are all the way disconnected the entire circle with sensors mounted will fallâ€¦ so make sure it doesnâ€™t have a ways to go.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/9vive.jpg" alt="vive controller screws" /></p>

<p>The top of the handle should now open when you pry it apart:</p>

<h2 id="the-fix">The fix</h2>

<p>For my controller both of these ribbon cables were entirely pulled out from their sockets.</p>

<p>I lifted up the small white tab on each one, reinserted the cables, and closed the tabs.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/11vive.jpg" alt="vive controller ribbon cables" /></p>

<p>Then I put everything else back the way I found it.</p>

<h2 id="it-worked">It worked!</h2>

<p>Hey it worked! My controller is now tracking again! The audio and haptic feedback no longer work thoughâ€¦ Likely damaged during the impact, but it could of also been from me opening up everything and maybe not being as careful as I should have been.</p>
