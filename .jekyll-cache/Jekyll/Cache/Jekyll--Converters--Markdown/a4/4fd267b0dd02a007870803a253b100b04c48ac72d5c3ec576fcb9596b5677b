I"Å<p>Created a landing page for block3. A blockchain workspace and knowledge hub in Seattle.</p>

<p>I was given an idea for a landing page and where it needed to link to.</p>

<p>Since no complicated were needed for the page I decided to use plain HTML and CSS to accomplish structure and styling. I used the built in CSS Grid property for responsive design.</p>

<p>While load time is very fast further improvemnts could be made with optimizations</p>
